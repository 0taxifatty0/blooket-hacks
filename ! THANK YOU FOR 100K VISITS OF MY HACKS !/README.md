Through out coding these I've been called **MANY** slurs and horid name and over all been called "fake" or a "fraud" I've pushed through it knowing I am myself.

I wanted to thank you all for **ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND** views/uses on my hacks, thank you for helping me through my jounrney, I will continue to thrive and keep making these hacks for you guys to enjoy.
